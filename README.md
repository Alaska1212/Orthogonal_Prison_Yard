# Orthogonal_Prison_Yard

This paper addresses the orthogonal prison yard problem, a variant of the classical art gallery visibility problem, where cameras must be placed to monitor both the internal and external areas of orthogonal polygons. A Delaunay triangulation was performed to identify optimal camera positions, and a greedy algorithm was applied to cover all triangles. The resulting solution achieves a practical approach with a computational complexity of O(n2).
